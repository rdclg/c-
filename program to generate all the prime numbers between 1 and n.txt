Write  a C++ program to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n ,where n is a value supplied by the user.
		
Code:
#include <iostream.h>   
#include <conio.h>     
int isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) {
        return 0;  
    }
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {  
        if (num % i == 0) {
            return 0;          }
    }
    return 1;  
}
void main() {
    int n;
    clrscr();  
                  cout << "Enter a number n to find all prime numbers between 1 and n: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Prime numbers between 1 and " << n << " are: ";
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (isPrime(i)) {
            cout << i << " ";  
        }
    }
    cout << endl;  
    getch();  
}
output-
Enter a number n to find all prime numbers between 1 and n: 5

Prime numbers between 1 and 5 are: 235
