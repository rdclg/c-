#include <iostream.h> 
int main() {
    int total_seconds, hours, minutes, seconds;
    cout << "Enter the number of seconds: ";
    cin >> total_seconds;
    hours = total_seconds / 3600;  
    total_seconds %= 3600;         
    minutes = total_seconds / 60;  
    seconds = total_seconds % 60; 
    cout << "Equivalent time: " << hours << " hours, " << minutes << " minutes, " << seconds << " seconds." << endl;
    return 0;
}	
output-

Enter the number of seconds: 400
