Show the use of virtual function.
Code:-
 #include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void start() {
        cout << "Vehicle is starting" << endl;
    }
};
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Car is starting" << endl;
    }
};
class Bike : public Vehicle {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Bike is starting" << endl;
    }
};
void main() {
    clrscr();
    Vehicle* vehiclePtr;
    Vehicle vehicleObj;
    Car carObj;
    Bike bikeObj;
    vehiclePtr = &vehicleObj;
    vehiclePtr->start();
    vehiclePtr = &carObj;
    vehiclePtr->start();
    vehiclePtr = &bikeObj;
    vehiclePtr->start();
    getch();
}
Output:-
vehicle is starting
car is starting
bike is starting
